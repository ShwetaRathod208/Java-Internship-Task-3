LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – PROJECT 
DOCUMENTATION 

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW


      The Library Management System is a complete Java console application for managing library 
      operations. It allows librarians to add books and register members, supports book 
      borrowing/returning with availability tracking, provides search functionality by 
      title/author/genre, and displays all books or available books only. Built with proper OOP 
      principles, the system uses encapsulation, ArrayList for dynamic storage, and input validation 
      throughout. 
      Primary Goals: 
      Manage book inventory with ISBN, title, author, genre, and availability status 
      Track library members and their borrowed books 
      Enable borrow/return operations with availability validation 
      Provide case-insensitive search across multiple book attributes 
      Offer intuitive menu-driven interface for all operations

   
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

   
      The main goals of this project are: 
      1. To understand and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java 
      2. To design classes using encapsulation with private data members and public methods 
      3. To manage books and library members efficiently 
      4. To implement borrowing and returning of books with proper validation 
      5. To provide search functionality for books by title, author, or genre 
      6. To build a menu-driven console application 
      7. To improve problem-solving and Java programming skills 
      8. To simulate a real-world library system using Java
  
         
3. SETUP & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

   
      1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on the system 
      2. Download JDK from the official Oracle or OpenJDK website 
      3. Verify Java installation by running the command java -version in the command prompt 
      4. Install a Java-supported IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code 
      5. Open the IDE and create a new Java project 
      6. Name the project as LibraryManagementSystem 
      7. Create a package (optional) named library or INTERNSHIP 
      8. Inside the package, create the following Java class files:
            o Book.java 
            o Member.java 
            o Library.java 
            o LibrarySystem.java 
      9. Copy the respective source code into each file and save them 
      10. Compile the project to ensure there are no errors 
      11. Run the LibrarySystem.java file which contains the main() method 
      12. The menu-driven Library Management System will start in the console
